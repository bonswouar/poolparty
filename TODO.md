# TODO

## SOON

- Clean code, improve security
- Use Piped configurable instance url
- Fine tune playback sync, add client options to force sync (one time action) and unsync ("soft" to prevent seeking, and "hard" to prevent song removing & seeking)

## LATER

- Search & add YT Playlists

## MAYBE

- Permissions & rooms
- Better playlist management (remove, change order, etc)
- Better design, & mobile app (?)
- Implement other sources (local? spotify? deezer?)
